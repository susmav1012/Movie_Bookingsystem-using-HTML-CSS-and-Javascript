        <h2>ABOUT OF THEATRE</h2>
        <p>CINEMAX Theatre’s mission is to give our customers a big city entertainment experience in a small town. Our customers will relax in comfort and watch high-quality presentations of popular second-run movies, all within a short walk or drive from home. This is a convenience that CINEMAX residents have had to do without since the local theatre closed eleven years ago.

We aim to please the local community (who can wait a few weeks to see their favorite movies and don’t want to pay big city, new release prices). We will also provide our customers with satisfying and reasonably priced snack foods and beverages.</p>
